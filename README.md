# QR Code Generator

A simple Python script to generate QR codes from text or URLs and save them as images.

## Features
- Generates QR codes from any text or URL
- Saves the QR code as an image file (`qr_code.png` by default)
- Uses the `qrcode` library for easy and efficient QR code creation

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the `qrcode` library:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or copy the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qr-code-generator.git
   cd qr-code-generator
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python qr_code_generator.py
   ```
3. Enter the text or URL when prompted.
4. The generated QR code will be saved as `qr_code.png` in the same directory.

## Example Output
After running the script and entering a URL, you will get a QR code image that can be scanned using a mobile device.
